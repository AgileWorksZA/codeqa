# Why Code Metrics Tracker (codeqa) Exists

## The Gap We Filled

After extensive analysis of the code quality tool landscape, we identified a significant gap: there was no tool that provided simple, local, historical tracking of code quality metrics for Python projects without requiring cloud services or complex infrastructure.

## Our Philosophy

Code Metrics Tracker was built on these principles:

1. **Local First**: Your code and metrics never leave your machine
2. **Git Native**: Metrics are version controlled alongside your code
3. **Zero Config**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
4. **Just Enough**: Not too simple, not too complex - just right
5. **CI/CD Ready**: Built for automation from day one

## What Sets Us Apart

### From Simple Analyzers
Tools like Radon, Pylint, and flake8 are excellent at what they do, but they:
- Only provide point-in-time analysis
- Don't track historical trends
- Require custom scripting for unified reports
- Need manual snapshot management

We integrate multiple analyzers and add historical tracking on top.

### From Enterprise Platforms
Solutions like SonarQube and CodeClimate are powerful, but they:
- Require server infrastructure or cloud accounts
- Often have usage limits or paid tiers
- Can be overkill for small to medium projects
- Raise privacy concerns for sensitive code

We provide essential features without the complexity or privacy concerns.

### From Similar Tools
The closest tool to ours (Wily) hasn't been updated since 2020. We provide:
- Active maintenance and regular updates
- Better tool integration (cloc + Ruff + Radon)
- GitHub Actions templates
- Modern Python support

## Key Features That Matter

### 1. One-Command Setup
```bash
pip install code-metrics-tracker
codeqa init
codeqa snapshot
```
That's it. You're tracking metrics.

### 2. Git-Integrated Workflow
- Metrics live in your repository
- Changes are tracked in version control
- Reports are in markdown for easy review
- Works with your existing git workflow

### 3. GitHub Actions Integration
```yaml
- name: Update code metrics
  run: |
    codeqa snapshot --only-on-changes
    git diff --exit-code || (git add CODE_METRICS.md && git commit -m "Update metrics")
```
Automatic tracking on every push.

### 4. Meaningful Reports
```markdown
## Historical Metrics

| Date | Code | Comments | Blanks | Total Lines |
|------|------|----------|--------|-------------|
| 2025-01-15 | 5,234 | 1,203 | 876 | 7,313 |
| 2025-01-10 | 5,189 (+45) | 1,198 (+5) | 872 (+4) | 7,259 (+54) |
```
See trends at a glance.

## Who Should Use Code Metrics Tracker

### Perfect For:
- Python developers who want simple quality tracking
- Teams needing local/private metric solutions
- Open source projects wanting transparent metrics
- CI/CD pipelines requiring quality gates
- Anyone who values simplicity over complexity

### Not Ideal For:
- Enterprise teams needing collaboration features
- Multi-language projects (Python-only for now)
- Teams wanting cloud dashboards
- One-time code audits

## Our Commitment

Code Metrics Tracker will always be:
- **Open Source**: MIT licensed, community-driven
- **Privacy-First**: Your code stays on your machine
- **Developer-Friendly**: Simple, clear, well-documented
- **Actively Maintained**: Regular updates and bug fixes

## The Bottom Line

We built Code Metrics Tracker because we needed it ourselves. After researching dozens of tools, we couldn't find one that was:
- Simple enough to use daily
- Powerful enough to be useful
- Private enough for proprietary code
- Automated enough for CI/CD

So we built it. And we think you'll find it useful too.
